Simple example project for the IceZero Board
--------------------------------------------

This example design outputs the pin description for each IO pin on that IO pin
using 9600 baud TTL-level RS232 signaling (+3.3V, non-inverted).

This example comes with its own IceZero programming tool (icezprog.c).
